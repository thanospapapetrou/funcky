log durations
reconsider SEVERE log messages
    should ERROR_LOADING_LIBRARY in Linker be an instance of compilation excepttion?
        no, because it's not expected to be thrown normally by user input
higher order function types inferred from function and argument
test with URLs from CLI
add description when throwing IOException as compilation exception?
run tests with http and https scripts
records

Nice to Have
linker link expression -> _

Do not log multiple configuration when running standalone

logging improvements
remove engine from ast, these are not compiled scripts any more

tokenizer is OK
logging except FunckyLoggerFactory is OK
parser is OK, except for engine removal

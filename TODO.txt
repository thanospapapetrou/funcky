higher order function types inferred from function and argument
test with URLs from CLI
add description when throwing IOException as compilation exception?
run tests with http and https scripts

Nice to Have

test records
monads
remove engine from ast, these are not compiled scripts any more
thread safety

Funcky> "funcky:records".unit
java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: funcky

use logging instead of System.out.println and System.err.println, because messages are not printed in correct order

instanceof -> pattern matching
cleanup, factory, engine and reduce eval methods
engine in values
engine always in expressions
cleanup linker, parser, tokenizer etc
separate bindings in context into scripts, imports, definitions etc
transpile
generics
new methods and tests for records
monads

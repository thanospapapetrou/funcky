log durations
reconsider SEVERE log messages
higher order function types inferred from function and argument
test with URLs from CLI
add description when throwing IOException as compilation exception?
run tests with http and https scripts
records

Nice to Have
linker link expression -> _

logging improvements
remove engine from ast, these are not compiled scripts any more
logging except FunckyLoggerFactory is OK
